# Stock Market Predictor

## 📌 Project Overview
This Stock Market Predictor is a machine learning-based web application that predicts stock prices using historical data. It utilizes features such as **Open, High, Low, and Volume** to forecast future stock trends. The model is built using **Linear Regression** and other machine learning techniques, and the web app is deployed using **Streamlit**.

## 🚀 Features
- Predicts stock prices based on historical market data.
- Uses **Linear Regression** for forecasting.
- Web-based UI built with **Streamlit**.
- Displays accuracy and classification metrics.
- Interactive visualizations of stock trends.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Machine Learning** (Linear Regression)
- **Streamlit** (Web App Deployment)
- **Git & GitHub** (Version Control)

## 📂 Installation & Setup
Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-URL>
cd stock-market-predictor

# Create a virtual environment (optional)
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
env\Scripts\activate     # On Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the Streamlit app
streamlit run app.py
```

## 📊 Usage
1. Upload a CSV file containing stock market data.
2. View the data insights and visualizations.
3. Enter desired input values to get stock price predictions.
4. Analyze the accuracy and performance of the model.

## 🏗️ Future Enhancements
- Implement more advanced machine learning models (LSTMs, XGBoost, etc.).
- Integrate real-time stock market API.
- Improve UI/UX for better user experience.
- Add more financial indicators for better predictions.
